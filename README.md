## Install

Install the dependencies using the requirements file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the `app.py` file

## Update dependencies

```sh
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Running in a virtual environment

It's easier to run the application in a virtual environment. To do this run the
following command:

```sh
# create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv /path/to/venv-directory

# activate the environment
cd /path/to/venv-directory
source bin/activate
```

One the environment is activated, you can clone the project directory (inside
the `venv-directory`) and add the dependencies. After the you can run the
project normally using the `python3` command.
